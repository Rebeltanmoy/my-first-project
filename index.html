                    <h1>Hungarian Mushroom Soup</h1>
                    <p>A warm, filling soup that is a wonderful cool weather lunch or dinner and is especially great
                        with a side of multi-grain bread! I load up on thickly cut mushrooms and use traditional
                        Hungarian Sweet Paprika. Um! Definitely use the tomato and pepper. It gives it a totally
                        different flavor. You may serve immediately or refrigerate and reheat. I find that the soup just
                        as good if not better the next day. Use a ripe tomato. Also, if you can't find a Hungarian wax
                        pepper, try another mild chile pepper and just use a smaller piece.</p>

                        strongly-flavored meat that needs to be marinated and cooked well to bring out its unique taste.
                        It features prominently in various cuisines across the globe, from American hamburgers and
                        British roasts to the classic Indian and Middle Eastern lamb curries and stews. When we focus on
                        Indian cuisine particularly, it is evident that mutton has been a favourite since ancient times,
